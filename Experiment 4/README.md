## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study the tuple data type in Python and understand the various operations that can be performed on tuples. This helps in learning how to store fixed and ordered data efficiently.

---

## 📌 Introduction

A tuple is a built-in data type in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable (immutable). Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be modified.

---

## 📖 Study of Operations on Tuple (Instructions)

* Understand what a tuple is and how it is created
* Learn how to access tuple elements
* Perform basic tuple operations
* Use built-in tuple functions
* Observe the immutability property of tuples
* Practice tuple-based programs regularly

---

## ✅ Advantages of Tuple

* Faster than lists
* Uses less memory
* Data remains safe (cannot be changed)
* Can store multiple data types
* Useful for fixed data collections

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Tuple

* Elements cannot be modified
* Less flexible compared to lists
* No methods to add or remove elements
* Difficult to update data

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

1. Creating a tuple
2. Accessing elements
3. Tuple immutability
4. Tuple methods
5. Indexing and slicing

---

## 📘 Theory (Operations on Tuple)

### 1. Creating a Tuple

A tuple is created using round brackets ().
Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)`

### 2. Accessing Elements

Elements are accessed using index numbers.
Example: `my_tuple[0]`

### 3. Tuple Immutability

Tuple elements cannot be changed once created.
Example: `my_tuple[1] = 10` (Error)

### 4. Tuple Operations

* len() – returns number of elements
* count() – counts occurrences of an element
* index() – returns index of an element

### 5. Tuple Concatenation

Tuples can be joined using + operator.
Example: `(1,2) + (3,4)`

### 6. Tuple Repetition

Tuples can be repeated using * operator.
Example: `(1,2) * 2`

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter
* IDLE
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Command Prompt / Terminal

---

## 📂 Applications of Tuple

* Storing fixed data
* Coordinates (x, y)
* Returning multiple values from functions
* Database records
* Read-only data storage

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Tuples are an important data structure in Python when data should not be changed. They are faster and safer than lists and are useful for handling fixed collections of data.

---

## 📎 Extra Notes

* Tuple indexing starts from 0
* Single-element tuple needs a comma: `(5,)`
* Tuples can contain lists
* Immutable but can be nested
