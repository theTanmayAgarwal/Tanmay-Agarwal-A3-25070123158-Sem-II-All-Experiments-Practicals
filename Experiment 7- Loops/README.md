## 📄 Title Page

**Project Name:** Study of Loops in Python <br/>
**Purpose:** Study of while loop, for loop and nested loops <br/>
**Language:** Python <br/>

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study loop statements in Python and understand the working of **while loops, for loops, and nested loops**.  
Loops help in executing a block of code repeatedly and reduce redundancy in programs.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Loops are an essential control structure in Python that allow execution of a block of code multiple times based on a condition or sequence.  
Python provides different types of loops such as **while loop**, **for loop**, and **nested loop**, which make programs efficient and concise.

* Makes programs shorter and efficient
* Useful for repetitive tasks
* Easy to modify and debug

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Loops

* Infinite loops can cause program crash
* Complex nested loops reduce readability
* Logical errors can be difficult to trace
* Improper conditions may lead to wrong output

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

* Looping statements
* Entry-controlled loops
* Exit conditions
* Iteration
* Nested loops
* Loop control flow

## 📘 Theory (Loops in Python)

### 1. While Loop

A **while loop** executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

**Syntax:**  
`while condition:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statement`

**Example:**  
`i = 1`  
`while i <= 5:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(i)`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`i += 1`

---

### 2. For Loop

A **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, or range.

**Syntax:**  
`for variable in sequence:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`statement`

**Example:**  
`for i in range(1, 6):`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(i)`

---

### 3. Nested Loop

A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop.  
The inner loop executes completely for each iteration of the outer loop.

**Example:**  
`for i in range(1, 4):`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`for j in range(1, 4):`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`print(i, j)`

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter
* Jupyter Notebook
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Command Prompt / Terminal

---

## 📂 Applications of Loops

* Repetitive calculations
* Pattern printing
* Data processing
* Automation tasks
* Iterating through data structures

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Loops are a fundamental concept in Python programming.  
Understanding **while loops, for loops, and nested loops** helps in writing efficient, readable, and powerful programs.  
Mastery of loops is essential for solving real-world programming problems.

## 📎 Extra Notes

* While loop is condition-based
* For loop is sequence-based
* Nested loops increase complexity
* Always ensure proper termination condition
* Avoid infinite loops
