# Python Programming Lab - Assignment 1

## #Program-1: Simple Calculator
### *Aim*
To create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on two user-provided numbers.

### *Theory*
In Python, the ⁠ input() ⁠ function is used to capture data from the user as a string. To perform mathematical operations, these strings must be converted into integers using the ⁠ int() ⁠ function. Arithmetic operators used include:
•⁠  ⁠⁠ + ⁠ (Addition)
•⁠  ⁠⁠ - ⁠ (Subtraction)
•⁠  ⁠⁠ * ⁠ (Multiplication)
•⁠  ⁠⁠ / ⁠ (Division)
•⁠  ⁠⁠ % ⁠ (Modulus - finds the remainder)

### *Steps*
1.⁠ ⁠Take two inputs from the user.
2.⁠ ⁠Typecast the inputs from string to integer.
3.⁠ ⁠Apply the arithmetic operators.
4.⁠ ⁠Print the results to the console.

### *Conclusion*
The program successfully demonstrates how to handle user input and perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## #Program-2: Sum and Average of Marks
### *Aim*
To calculate the total sum and the average marks of five students.

### *Theory*
The *Sum* is the total value of all inputs combined. The *Average* (Mean) is calculated by taking the total sum and dividing it by the count of inputs (in this case, 5).

### *Steps*
1.⁠ ⁠Accept five separate inputs representing marks.
2.⁠ ⁠Convert all inputs to integers.
3.⁠ ⁠Sum the five values together.
4.⁠ ⁠Divide the total sum by 5 to find the average.
5.⁠ ⁠Display both the total and the average.

### *Conclusion*
The program effectively calculates statistical data from multiple integer inputs.

## #Program-3: Area of a Circle
### *Aim*
To find the area of a circle based on a user-defined radius.

### *Theory*
The area of a circle is calculated using the mathematical formula:
$$Area = \pi r^2$$
In this program, we use *3.14* as the constant for $\pi$ and $r$ as the radius provided by the user.

### *Steps*
1.⁠ ⁠Accept the radius ($r$) as input.
2.⁠ ⁠Convert the input to an integer.
3.⁠ ⁠Calculate the area using the formula $3.14 * r * r$.
4.⁠ ⁠Print the final area.

### *Conclusion*
The program demonstrates the implementation of geometric formulas using Python variables.

---

## #Program-4: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
### *Aim*
To compute the area and the perimeter of a rectangle using its length and breadth.

### *Theory*
•⁠  ⁠*Area* is the total space inside the rectangle: $$Area = Length \times Breadth$$
•⁠  ⁠*Perimeter* is the total distance around the rectangle: $$Perimeter = 2 \times (Length + Breadth)$$

### *Steps*
1.⁠ ⁠Input the length ($l$) and breadth ($b$).
2.⁠ ⁠Convert both values to integers.
3.⁠ ⁠Calculate Area ($l * b$).
4.⁠ ⁠Calculate Perimeter ($2 * (l + b)$).
5.⁠ ⁠Output both results.

### *Conclusion*
The program successfully implements multiple geometric calculations in a single script.
