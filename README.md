## 🧠 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of:
- Understanding datasets
- Identifying patterns and trends
- Detecting anomalies and outliers
- Preparing data for deeper analysis and modeling  

EDA forms the **backbone of data-driven decision making** and is a crucial step before applying machine learning or statistical models.
