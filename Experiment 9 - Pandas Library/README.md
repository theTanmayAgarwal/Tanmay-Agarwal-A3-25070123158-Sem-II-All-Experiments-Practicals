## Title Page

**Project Name:** Study of Pandas Library in Python <br/>
**Purpose:** Understanding Data Manipulation and Analysis using Pandas <br/>
**Language:** Python <br/>

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study the **Pandas library** in Python and understand how it is used for data manipulation and analysis.

This project focuses on:

* Creating Series and DataFrames  
* Reading and writing data files  
* Data selection and filtering  
* Handling missing values  
* Performing statistical operations  
* Grouping and sorting data  

---

## 📌 Introduction

Pandas is one of the most important Python libraries used for **data analysis and data manipulation**.

It provides powerful data structures such as:

* Series (1D data structure)  
* DataFrame (2D tabular data structure)  

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is widely used in:

* Data Science  
* Machine Learning  
* Finance  
* Business Analytics  

It allows easy handling of structured data like CSV files, Excel files, and databases.

# 📘 THEORY (Pandas Library)

---

# 1️⃣ Importing Pandas

Pandas is imported using:



import pandas as pd


Here, `pd` is an alias used for convenience.

---

# 2️⃣ Pandas Series

## 📌 Definition

A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.

### Example:



import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(data)


A Series consists of:

* Values  
* Index  

Custom index can also be provided:



pd.Series([10,20,30], index=["a","b","c"])


---

# 3️⃣ Pandas DataFrame

## 📌 Definition

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and labeled data structure with rows and columns.

It is similar to a table in a database or an Excel sheet.

### Example:



data = {
"Name": ["A", "B", "C"],
"Marks": [85, 90, 88]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


---

# 4️⃣ Reading Data from CSV File

Pandas allows reading data from external files.



df = pd.read_csv("file.csv")


Common functions:

* `df.head()` → First 5 rows  
* `df.tail()` → Last 5 rows  
* `df.info()` → Information about dataset  
* `df.describe()` → Statistical summary  

---

# 5️⃣ Data Selection and Indexing

## Using loc (label-based indexing)



df.loc[0]


## Using iloc (position-based indexing)



df.iloc[0]


Selecting specific column:



df["Marks"]


Selecting multiple columns:



df[["Name", "Marks"]]


---

# 6️⃣ Filtering Data

Filtering is done using conditions.



df[df["Marks"] > 85]


This returns rows where marks are greater than 85.

---

# 7️⃣ Handling Missing Values

Missing values are common in datasets.

Functions used:

* `df.isnull()`  
* `df.notnull()`  
* `df.dropna()` → Remove missing values  
* `df.fillna()` → Replace missing values  

Example:



df.fillna(0)


---

# 8️⃣ Sorting Data

Sorting data using:



df.sort_values("Marks")


Sorting by multiple columns:



df.sort_values(["Marks", "Name"])


---

# 9️⃣ GroupBy Operation

GroupBy is used to group data based on certain categories.



df.groupby("Department").mean()


It is commonly used in data analysis for aggregation.

---

# 🔟 Descriptive Statistics

Pandas provides built-in statistical functions:

* `df.mean()`  
* `df.sum()`  
* `df.min()`  
* `df.max()`  
* `df.count()`  
* `df.std()`  

Example:



df["Marks"].mean()
