## Title Page

**Project Name:** Operations on Sets and Dictionaries in Python  
**Purpose:** Study of Sets and Dictionaries and Their Operations  
**Language:** Python  

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study **Sets and Dictionaries** in Python and understand the various operations that can be performed on them. This helps in learning how to store, manage, and manipulate data efficiently using these data structures.

---

## 📌 Introduction

**Set** and **Dictionary** are built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.

- A **Set** stores unique elements and does not allow duplicate values.
- A **Dictionary** stores data in **key–value pairs**, where each key is unique.

Both are widely used in real-world Python applications.

## 📖 Study of Sets and Dictionaries (Instructions)

* Understand what Sets and Dictionaries are
* Learn how to create Sets and Dictionaries
* Perform basic operations on Sets
* Access, update, and delete Dictionary elements
* Use built-in methods of Sets and Dictionaries
* Practice programs regularly to strengthen concepts

---

## ✅ Advantages

### ✔ Advantages of Set
* Stores only unique elements
* Fast membership checking
* Supports mathematical operations
* Useful for removing duplicates
* Unordered data storage

### ✔ Advantages of Dictionary
* Fast data retrieval using keys
* Stores data in structured form
* Keys are unique
* Highly efficient for large data
* Easy to update and modify

---

## ❌ Disadvantages

### ✖ Disadvantages of Set
* Unordered collection
* Does not support indexing
* Mutable but elements must be immutable
* Limited use for ordered data

### ✖ Disadvantages of Dictionary
* Unordered (before Python 3.7)
* Consumes more memory
* Keys must be unique
* Slightly complex syntax for beginners

## 📘 Theory

### 🔹 Operations on Set

#### 1. Creating a Set
A set is created using curly brackets `{}`.
Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

#### 2. Adding Elements
Elements can be added using `add()` method.
Example: `my_set.add(5)`

#### 3. Removing Elements
Elements can be removed using `remove()` or `discard()`.
Example: `my_set.remove(2)`

#### 4. Set Operations
* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Symmetric Difference

#### 5. Set Methods
* `add()`
* `remove()`
* `discard()`
* `pop()`
* `clear()`

### 🔹 Operations on Dictionary

#### 1. Creating a Dictionary
A dictionary is created using curly brackets with key–value pairs.
Example: `my_dict = {"name": "Tanmay", "age": 18}`

#### 2. Accessing Values
Values are accessed using keys.
Example: `my_dict["name"]`

#### 3. Updating Values
Values can be updated using keys.
Example: `my_dict["age"] = 19`

#### 4. Removing Elements
Elements can be removed using `pop()` or `del`.
Example: `del my_dict["age"]`

#### 5. Dictionary Methods
* `keys()`
* `values()`
* `items()`
* `get()`
* `update()`

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter
* IDLE
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Command Prompt / Terminal

---

## 📂 Applications

### Applications of Set
* Removing duplicate values
* Membership testing
* Mathematical set operations
* Data filtering
* Unique data storage

### Applications of Dictionary
* Student records
* Database management
* Configuration settings
* Counting frequency of elements
* Real-time data mapping

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Sets and Dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python.  
Sets are best used when **unique values** are required, while Dictionaries are ideal for storing and accessing **key–value based data** efficiently. Understanding these structures improves problem-solving and coding efficiency.

---

## 📎 Extra Notes

* Sets do not allow duplicate values
* Sets are unordered and unindexed
* Dictionary keys must be unique
* Dictionary values can be of any data type
* Both are mutable data structures
